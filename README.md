üìã Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have:

N8N Instance: Self-hosted or cloud N8N instance
OpenRouter API Key: For AI content generation
Notion Integration: Database setup and API token
Node.js: Version 16+ (for local development)

üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-game-content-generator.git
cd ai-game-content-generator

2. N8N Workflow Setup
bash# Import the workflow JSON file into your N8N instance
# File: n8n-workflow.json

# Configure the following credentials in N8N:
# - OpenRouter API Key
# - Notion API Token
# - Database ID

3. Environment Configuration
N8N Workflow Variables
javascript// OpenRouter API Configuration
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-api-key
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions

// Notion Configuration
NOTION_API_TOKEN=your-notion-integration-token
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your-database-id

// Webhook URLs (auto-generated by N8N)
GENERATE_CONTENT_WEBHOOK=https://your-n8n-instance.onrender.com/webhook/generate-content
APPROVE_CONTENT_WEBHOOK=https://your-n8n-instance.onrender.com/webhook/approve-content
Frontend Configuration
javascript// Update API endpoints in your frontend JavaScript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-n8n-instance.onrender.com';
const GENERATE_ENDPOINT = `${API_BASE_URL}/webhook/generate-content`;
const APPROVE_ENDPOINT = `${API_BASE_URL}/webhook/approve-content`;


üéØ Usage

1. Generate Content
